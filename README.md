Smart Traffic light system
=========
## Functions:
>* Remain basic traffic light functions
>* Control the time of traffic lights according to traffic flow to improve traffic conditions
\<br> 
## System constructure
Sensors feed back data to the Raspberry Pi, and then control the running status of traffic lights through the Raspberry Pi. <br>
